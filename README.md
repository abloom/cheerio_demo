# Cheerio Demo

Two simple examples to demonstrate using Cheerio.

# Setup

  `npm install`

  `make test`

# Discussion

* `test/read_test.coffee` - example of parsing HTML response from a web server and validating and extracting content

* `src/tag.coffee` - class that uses Cheerio to construct HTML elements. Examples of how it can be used are in `test/write_test.coffee
